      " I learned how to clean up a dataset from observations and turn it into a prediction model\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to use plots like scatterplots and histograms\n",
      "\n",
      " I found todays lab to be quite useful in solidifying knowledge of numpy Specifically the exercises towards to end of graphing histograms and box plots were completely new to me In addition extra practice with string manipulation was very useful  I finally processed how to start at the end of the string instead of just the beginning\n",
      "\n",
      " I got a sneak peek into the Data science workflowgoing from a problem statement to cleaning data to honing on a set of features to building and evaluating a model I learned some of the intuition behind picking a certain kind of model for a given problem \n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to do basic evaluations of datasets with numpy including learning how to visualize the data to make better models build models based on inferences and evaluate models to improve them\n",
      "\n",
      " We learned more python techniques to use reshape NumPy and sklearn and analytical skills  how to look at the data plot and how to normalize the dataset We also learned some facets to consider when evaluating a model\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned about how to utilize pair plots to determine which pairs of variables have the clearest relationships I also learned how to access documentation within Jupyter notebook \n",
      "\n",
      " I learned more about indexing and how to do 2D indexing Also learned how to make plots and scale\n",
      "\n",
      " One thing we learned was how to create different plots like the box plot and the scatter plot and how to ready the data in order to create those plots \n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to manipulate a numpy array so that it is easier to graph and analyze the data\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned a basic application of machine learning\n",
      "\n",
      " Today I learned how to read a box and whiskers plot and how to use it to choose a suitable criteria for predictive analytics\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned to reshape arrays and that most numpy functions do not actually transform the data but only return it\n",
      "\n",
      " Carefully selecting features through data exploration can be important for simple classification tasks especially when the model only utilizes a single feature Having chosen sepalwidth over petalwidth could have lead to a much lower classification accuracy I expect that measuring the degree to which the input each of the features are correlated with the labels will be very important when using models that take multiple inputs Loosely correlated features may add noise so we may have to choose to omit them or utilize a model that factors for this\n",
      "\n",
      " When were using data science to solve classification problem the differentiation effect a certain variable depends heavily on whether it has a small or large spread Small spread means that data tends to be similar and cluster together which makes them harder to be differentiated \n",
      "\n",
      " We learned how to organize data into structures that numpy can use We also learned how to display our data in ways that were useful in analyzing the data\n",
      "\n",
      " Something that I thought was particularly useful was just furthering my understanding of numpy arrays More specifically I though t that the ability to index an array based on the npwhere was particularly informative and useful \n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to use python to make box plots histograms paired plots are various other statistical graphs to analyze data\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to pull data from a list of arrays and display data in the form of box plots histograms and scatter plots We learned how to process a set of data in a cohesive workflow from collecting and reading the data filtering displaying and making predictions\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned to use simple machine learning method to train a model for the iris data set\n",
      "\n",
      " We need to dig into the data we have before working on the problem we want to solve For example we evaluated the features before choosing the training data\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to make scatterplots and boxplots in r with data while also learning how to separate certain parts of the data\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned that box plots arent entirely accurate when it comes to representing data Only after scaling the data did the box plots provide much more accurate results\n",
      "\n",
      " Today Ive gained a better understanding of data visualization in python The demonstration of data is as important as the data itself\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to make plots in python and how to scale values from  to 1 so we can see a more accurate trends in data\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned that you can pair an object with a numberindex using the enumerate function When used in combination with a for loop enumerate allows you to iterate through both a list of indexes and a list of objects in synchrony\n",
      "\n",
      " I used my drop for todays lab due to a personal circumstance I am doing this quiz with the intention of dropping it as well because I tried the lab myself but only had the short timeframe doing it on my own but figured I would give this quiz a try The building and evaluating models and making predictions was really interesting to learn because it helped me understand arrays more clearly in Python and also gave me a chance to link this class to my Engineering Probability  Statistics class \n",
      "\n",
      " I learned the importance of clarity when it comes to establishing a hypothesis and explaining the significance of findings \n",
      "\n",
      " Today I improved my knowledge of navigating the NumPy addin as well as how to build a box plot After learning this I learned how easy it is to reference certain data points in the entire data set to develop a visual representation Theres histograms scatter plots and pair plots that can help reveal which features in a model might serve as the stronger metric to use as a frame of reference \n",
      "\n",
      " One thing I learned from todays lab is how to get the features and enumerate with loops\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned that numpy has many builtin functions that make computation much more efficient\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how to find a specific column in a 2d array via slicing\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned that by comparing two numpy arrays they will directly return a numpy array of booleans So I do not need to compare using two for loops This method will be way more efficient than using iterations through for loop\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned how you can really easily modify and scale numpy arrays with inbuilt python operators much faster than looping through with a double loop\n",
      "\n",
      " I learned what features are and how to assess which features are betterthe best in distinguishing certain species of flowers the same principle applies in general to many data science problems specifically determining which features are the most revealingdescriptive of a particular itemobject\n",
      "\n",
      " I gained more practice with indexing and became more comfortable with numPy operations in python like how to find the min and max I also learned a little more about a possible implementation of the machine learning workflow using arrays and a rule of thumb for the division of training and test data\n",
